ETH. anything/BTC is tanking\n\n\\- ETH wakes up (+- current situation) and we have a gigantic volatility on ETH/BTC chart, money moves between those 2 + some major alts\n\n\\- ETH season is done and we have a situation where money flows from ETH into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap)\n\n\\- Alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping\n\n\\- Finally once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. Your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.\n\nThe latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into BTC again. The alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ATH (that's basically 99% of you in this sub).\n\nYou also don't keep all of your converted BTC when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for FIAT (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or something) or stablecoins. You can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 30% APY while your fiat gets you close to zero APY.\n\nOnce the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy BTC again because nobody is buying BTC at ATL except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10.\n\nRepeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to global top = ATH of your coin) and then 25% gradually at each local top of your favorite crypto.\n\nI'll send an invoice to y'all later on, you can thank me later. Ok, bye."}

We get comfort from tricking ourselves that someone or something can accurately tell us what is going to happen.\n\n\nBut really, there is little reason to think that crypto is going to play out the same way this time as last time. Even if it makes you feel in control to believe it will.\n\n\nFirstly, there has never been a moat between investments in the same way before. BTC and ETH have large institutional investments through ETFs and treasury funds. None of that money is going to move to assets which don't have those tradfi products.\n\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin and Ethereum have, in different ways, now got mainstream adoption at a level that does not correlate to any previous cycle. Visa, Blackrock, Sony, Deutsche Bank etc etc have all [built projects onchain](https://ethereumadoption.com/built-on-ethereum) that they aren't going to move.\n\n\nI think it is foolish to assume yourself that everything will just play out along the same pattern as last time again.

{"id": "n82v3wg", "author": "MinimalGravitas", "body": "Which chain are you asking about, it works differently for different networks.\n\n\nFor Ethereum and similar, entities that are staking run special nodes called 'validators'. To run one you lock a certain amount of the chain's native asset (in this case 32 ETH) which is 'at stake'.\n\n\nThe network then semi-randomly rotates through choosing a validator each slot (block) to propose a set of transactions to be included. A larger selection of validators are chosen to attest (vote) for accepting that proposed block or not. Assuming it is fine, that block then gets added to the chain. The proposer and the attestors all get a little reward for participating.\n\n\nIf a validator misses a proposal or an attestation that they were selected for then they lose roughly the same amount of ETH as they would have earned if they had done the job. This means that if you run a validator it needs to be online more than half of the time or else you will on average lose ETH rather than gain.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if a validator is intentionally misbehaving, such as voting both ways for attestations or something then they can get 'slashed'. This means the network takes and burns some of the ETH you have put at stake. This is largely where the security of the mechanism comes from, because bad actors will be punished financially."}

{"id": "n871ho6", "author": "decomposition_", "body": "Leveraging scares me so I won’t do it — I know this is effectively a similar thing but with a liquidation point at practically half of bitcoin’s current value, a loan that I’d only carry for two weeks, and being able to capture more growth than if I had DCA’d in (I even tested this with starting in a downward trend, from Jan 1 2022 to Mar 2024), it really seems like a solid strategy. \n\nBut since it seems too good to be true I figured I’d post this for feedback from other people to see what I’m missing. My logic is that if I invest the monthly up front rather than daily over the course of a month, you capture more of that growth as your average would be higher if you did it daily. \n\nTwo weeks worth in a loan isn’t a significant amount of money, so if bitcoin began to reverse its trend I could easily afford to close the loan out immediately before it hits the liquidation point. Then I’d hold off on the loans and continue with my usual daily DCA strategy until the market stabilized. Do you get what I mean?"}
