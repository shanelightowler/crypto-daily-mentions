Though with its existence being strictly math & computationally-based, it can be quite easy to divide that 1 BTC into millionths to buy a banana if you wanted to... but it's grown more into a store of value on its own.

Or that it's hopeless because someone lost some on an old hard drive? There are still ships buried under the sea with billions in gold coins/bullion, that didn't slow gold down lol.\n\nDefinitely not going to play the \"what if X happens someday!?\" where the mechanism isn't even realistic.
