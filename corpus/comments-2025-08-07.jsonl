One day you'll be sitting around navel gazing and a stray thought will just pop into your head and you'll be like, \"Oh, wait, *that* was alt season?!\"\n\nBut there *are* some leading indicators. The one I like to watch is the ETH/BTC ratio. It's simple in concept and easy to understand and follow (even for you people).\n\nETH is the top altcoin. By comparing its price relative to BTC you get an idea of how the altcoin market is doing as a whole. Right now, the ratio is pulling itself up from a low of about .018. We've seen recent upward impulses to .025 and now .034. The ratio increases as the price of ETH increases. When (if) it reaches .07 or higher, you're in alt season territory. It'd be best if you start thinking about an exit strategy  and take some profits. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter."}

Miners followed the easy money and switched, effectively selling out the network for a quick win, a bit like the old sushiswap vampire attack on uniswap. Should be a warning shot that PoW doesn't give security by itself, can still be sabotaged by economic incentives. And this was pretty much the original PoS argument, that it all boils down to economics anyway so why bother with mining. \n\nBut wouldn't be too concerned either, XMR already had very concentrated mining in that pool which was already unhealthy, didn't require too much more concentration to endanger the network. But networks should have considerations to disincentivise large mining pools to try avoid stuff like this, many of the more modern networks have stuff like this already whether PoS or PoW and ofc many have a 66% threshold rather than 51%. BTC not so much but already low concentration and just very large to attack + miners locked into sunk cost of specialised mining equipment for BTC whereas XMR has always tried to make ASICs pointless via their hash function, so probably very hard to replicate this on BTC.\n\nBut yeah XMR just got a solid scare and the price reflects that, will still be questions as to whether this is over or if they can still lose control, what needs to change to stop this happening again etc etc. Allowing ASICs kills one of the networks main principles by locking out regular people, some kind of disincentive on large mining pools makes the cost to run the network go up, there are loads of tradeoffs."}
