Why on earth wouldn't you want to buy more BTC as price drops?\n\nThe cycles are over. BTC isn't moved by John/Jane -Q-Public anymore.

But if you think that were gonna drop into a multi year winter, then ill talk to ya then too...\n\nFWIW, ive been f-ing about in this space since 2018. I was in the exact same place as you. And id have been better off just buying BTC no matter the price and gone about my day, vs trying to be a trader and time entries/exits etc. We all tried, and failed, many times over. But ask anyone who has been here consistently for over 4-5 years what they think, look for what's consistent between them. they'll all tell you the same thing. Buy BTC + HODL = Profit...

The way I treat gaps is as an imbalance/inefficiency being formed that needs to be cleaned up. and that gap would occur if we open Monday higher than Friday's high.
