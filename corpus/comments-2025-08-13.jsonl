A large number of the biggest financial companies in the world have [built projects](https://ethereumadoption.com/built-on-ethereum/) on Ethereum and its rollup ecosystem, so it shouldn't be surprising that as they start to invest in crypto assets that is where they go.\n\n\nWith that said, plenty of 'alts' are up double digit percentage points this week, and 'LINK' is up more than ETH over that short timeframe, so maybe 'stalled' isn't quite the word you mean? Unless you are looking at even shorter time scales... in which case there probably doesn't need to be a reason beyond the fact that at that level noise outweighs any signal you might hope to look for."}
