Anyway, I still thought, let's buy some moons cheap and be patient, eventually the maintenance will be over.\n\nSo today I saw that the maintenance was finished and that withdraw option was enabled, so I again sold some moons on Sushiswap and bought moons on MEXC from $0.085 to $0.11 (regular price like on all exchamges).\n\nSo arbitrage trading earned me close to $800, plus I helped a lot to bring the moon price back to normal levels which is a good thing because MEXC tagged the moon/usdt trading pair with 'ST' which means that they were reviewing it and considering to delist it. So now I guess they won't delist it since the price is at normal levels.\n\nIt feels great nowüôÇ"}
