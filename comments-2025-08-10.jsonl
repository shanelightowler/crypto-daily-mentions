{"id": "n7zg3zw", "author": "VariatCA", "body": "I noticed that buttcorn thread speculating on what happens when the U.S. approaches the next presidency. I'm confident in the long term as Bitcoin was around & survived just fine before Trump & government involvement, and will most likely continue trucking along just fine when he's gone.\n\nThough in the short-term, a couple years from now? I think it absolutely depends on the state of the economy by the time his term is winding down, as well as if he's still in the good graces of Republicans by then. \n\nIf the economy remains strong and we avoid another black swan event like recession/pandemic/financial collapse, there's no reason to believe this \"cycle\" wouldn't continue uninterrupted and outlook for the foreseeable future can remain positive.\n\nIf things are a mess for Americans (even if the stock markets are strong), or some huge scandal is enveloping Trump by 2028 or whatever, there's a chance that the next Republican and/or Democrat frontrunners will campaign on distancing themselves as far as possible from everything Trump had involvement with.\n\nIn that vein, it's plausible that Crypto could go under siege again by the U.S. government/institutions as they reel back the influence he's had on it and other policies over the last term."}

The hope is that it's either somehow perfectly flat, or very slightly hot, to quell worries that the economy's prices are back on the uptick.\n\nA flat / barely hot CPI would also make it an easier sell for the FED to lower rates potentially in September to combat the jobs data. If inflation is coming in hot, that's going to give extra worries of rate-cuts compounding runaway inflation even more.\n\nIf the markets shrivel up on Monday in anticipation, crypto will probably pull back as well for the short-term until Tuesday presents the data and the markets can absorb/translate it."}

It won't return as much potential as trying to time \"the top\", wherever that may be, but I've learned that if you wait to sell at \"the top\", you won't know where the top is until it's too late & you're stuck holding again.\n\nI know the subject of taking profit is a bit taboo around here sometimes, but the last few years browsing /CC has shown what happens when people let euphoria and huge expectations get in the way."}

{"id": "n7v46gc", "author": "ieatvegans", "body": "In the summer of 2025, the crypto world crackled with anticipation. Bitcoin, the reigning giant, held a $2 trillion market cap, its price steady at $60,000. Ethereum, at $600 billion, was the underdog, but murmurs of a flippening echoed through online forums. The Crypto Summit in Dubai, a magnet for coders, traders, and dreamers, set the stage under a scorching desert [sky.Zara](http://sky.Zara), a 25-year-old developer, stood at the center of the storm. She‚Äôd been building on Ethereum since her teens, crafting dApps for everything from micro-loans in Africa to tokenized art in Tokyo. Her latest creation, Pulse, a layer-2 scaling solution, promised to cut fees to pennies while processing millions of transactions per second. Pulse was set to launch on Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet during the summit, and the buzz was palpable.Bitcoin maximalists roamed the conference halls, clutching hardware wallets and preaching Bitcoin‚Äôs supremacy as the ultimate store of value. But Zara saw their confidence fraying. Institutional investors were hedging, drawn to Ethereum‚Äôs vibrant ecosystem of NFTs, DeFi, and DAOs‚Äîa living economy, not just a digital vault.On the summit‚Äôs second day, Pulse launched. Ethereum‚Äôs network roared to life, transactions flying at unprecedented speed. Fees crashed, and DeFi platforms like Uniswap and Aave saw record volumes. Social media exploded: ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs unstoppable!‚Äù #Flippening trended worldwide. By nightfall, Ethereum‚Äôs price surged past $4,800, narrowing the gap with Bitcoin‚Äôs $60,000.Then came the bombshell. A coalition of tech titans‚ÄîGoogle, Visa, and a shadowy AI outfit called xAI‚Äîannounced they‚Äôd integrate Ethereum for cross-border payments and smart contracts. The market roared. Ethereum‚Äôs market cap hit $800 billion overnight, while Bitcoin dipped to $55,000 as traders cashed out.Zara watched the charts on her phone, pulse racing. Her 10 ETH savings were riding on this. By the summit‚Äôs final day, Ethereum‚Äôs price climbed to $10,000, its market cap matching Bitcoin‚Äôs at $1.3 trillion. The flippening had arrived, quiet but undeniable.By late 2025, Ethereum hit $50,000. Zara‚Äôs stake was now worth half a million. From her balcony in Lagos, she gazed at the city‚Äôs glowing skyline. Ethereum wasn‚Äôt just currency‚Äîit was a platform for builders like her, untouchable by banks. Bitcoin still had its diehards, but the tide had turned. The network was king.\n\n(Grok kinda fucked up BTC price)"}

The institutions/whales are happy and remain confident, and BTC's strength is a solid backdrop for alts to rally against & individually outperform Bitcoin. \n\nWe all win in a scenario like that (except the shorters)."}
